You learn to solve problems from the first lecture on. I downloaded python and the ide and took 50 lectures on the first day. Some minor inconsistencies did not pose a big problem, I could follow everything straight away. It would be helpful if it was explained in more detail how to find the functions you need. Dir() and help() are ok but I would not know what to do if I wanted to draw data from an excell list. I know there must be information in the internet but you could show us your methods like useful websites, books etc. At the end you have to be able to solve your own problems, an overview in different areas is definitely helpful but understanding how to get the necessary information is key."

However some of the code and lessons here can be somewhat outdated like the %s formatting method, which can easily be replaced and understood in an easier way with the new f string interpolation method that was introduced in python 3.6, and sometimes the explanations Ardit gives are vague and requires a bit more repetition in order to fully grasp the messages and concepts he's conveying. Other than those two criticisms that I noted, this course is overall decent and is worth a buy especially for the coding exercises and the building of 10 real world applications in this course."

Personally, I fell that some project (from 5 to 9) are excessively narrative, meaning that all technology/library is explained in the making of the project. As such, it feels that we are merely copying code. I think it would be more interesting to have the material as an autonomous lecture and the project as in project 10, i.e., an independent project where the objective is shown and we have to code by our own.

The programs are interesting to elaborate, but it would be interesting to have a lesson on code structure, e.g., how to structure the scripts in the virtual environment, script structure, etc.

Nonetheless, I feel this course is interesting and that it catapults the Python understanding and knowledge of a person from a beginner to an intermediate level."

100 Python Challenges to Boost Your Python Skills,Fernando Martinez,2019-08-14 22:26:21+00:00,4.5,"This was a good course for me to solidify my knowledge of python basics.  This course is definitely for people who have already taken a course or two on Python and want a bunch of practice exercises to do.  I did not find the video ""explanations"" to be very helpful but I did appreciate that the instructor posted solutions to all of the problems that I could review when I got stuck.  Definitely also need to  be able search for solution hints on stack overflow if you don't want to just look at the instructor solution.  Overall I'm glad I took this course.  I especially appreciated doing some exercises using the glob module and the difflib module that I was not very familiar with.  I would love the instructor to consider a follow-up course with another 100 exercises that explore more modules within the standard library for ""low intermediate"" learners like me to practice on.  Thanks!"

Really appreciated the work of Ardit Sir.
He had done a really well job.
But, i think one more topic you can include is the use of Django framework.It is one of the useful frameworks.Although the topics you covered are awesome.
And yes i will definietely going to use the knowledge you provided me in this journey.
When i will make something using python, i would like to share it with you.
Last thing i want to say is,


Very Very Thank you Sir. you may have put me ahead in life.

Sorry for bad english"

Just some remarks on my experience: I enjoyed section 6 and 7 not so much, it was very dry. When we were finally able to build the interactive english dictionary i assumed we would play around a bit more with that making ourselves more familiar. Also the tkinter seems to be a very specific thing to learn, (i want to learn more about the webapps), but I assume you do it for us getting more familiair with connecting backend to frontend so later on we can more easily use these concepts on the web. Maybe good to mention why you choose for specific sections, just to bring us along on the journey you have in mind for us, expectation management wise. anyhow overall so far so good!"

The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications,Daniel Rae,2019-07-19 06:30:11+00:00,5.0,"Yes, great course so far.  Ardit tackles Python in a good way that is different from other tutors as he doesn't start at raw basics like x == y .. he uses real world programs then dissects the program into it's core components line for line.   For me, this is very helpful as I can relate the course content to real world output.  I can see how the programs start, end and how they are put together.  You don't necessarily need to understand everything, but starting with the whole concept and breaking it down is nice.  Ardit's accent is a little unusual at first - but I know English isn't his first language but his English is very good so no problem, just takes a few lectures to understand the phonetics.  Another plus is Ardit uses a remote server (linux) so we deploy the programs remotely and then run them .. again, this is useful as this is what you would need to do in a real world context.  So Ardit uses real-world teaching methods and contextualises the course content so we are working an a more practical way.
Just to update .. Ardit has since updated the course and it is even better!  I'd like to mention that for me, if I play Ardit talking at 1.25x this is perfect.  In fact it makes his short lectures so much on point it really is probably the best lecture type course I am currently busy with.  I'm doing many Python courses just now and Ardit is one of my top 3 lecturers.  Again, because the course is broken down into short manageable videos that are action specific and there are many short practice tasks/quizzes/exercises that are key.  So many courses get the questions too complicated and end up making the student frustrated.  Ardit avoids this and his course is perfect watched at 1.25 x speed.  Awesome stuff!"

The big problem however is he tells you ""how to"" not ""why it is"". A great example of this is when he is teaching about how to look up problems at stack overflow. There are 2 answers one is downvoted where the ""teacher"" is questioning why it is down voted, because the answer is correct. The answer is basically ""this doesn't work"" providing no solution to how to get it to work or explains why it doesn't work. I feel the course has many of the same problems throughout. It is a ton of ""this is how it is"" teaching not why and how."

Instructor has not explained things which are not used in projects. Course is good till section 6. But after that it gets boring and only the project explanation which will not clear your concepts of python

100 Python Challenges to Boost Your Python Skills,Albrecht Kadauke,2019-07-14 08:42:52+00:00,3.0,"Idee ist prima, denn nur durch eigenes Coden lernt man es. - Die Umsetzung ist aber noch ziemlich holprig, der Udemy Server gibt Fehler an, die im lokalen Interpreter als korrekt durchgehen (zu kleinlich) und es werden oft wenig hilfreiche Fehlermeldungen gemacht (""Wrong code, try again""). Das ist frustrierend und hat dazu geführt, daß ich den Autor mit vielen Fragen gleichen Inhalts, warum meine Antwort denn falsch sei, überhäufen mußte. Er antwortete immer prompt und hilfreich.
Vorschlag für hilfreichere Fehlermeldungen: 
- Originaltext der Fehlermeldung ausgeben, ggf. für Ungeübte erklären (z.B. ""Fehler kann auch in der Zeile darüber liegen""), kryptische Texte vereinfachen (s. https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html , Concrete Exceptions )
- Allgemeiner Code-Check wie:   ""Schreibfehler?"", ""wie ändert sich der Wert beim beim 1. /2./3. ... Schleifendurchlauf?"", ""Stimmt der Datentyp"", ""Zwischenwerte mit print() erhalten"", ""Datentyp mit type() ermitteln"" ...
- Spezieller Code-Check: Einblenden von ""Hints"" bei Fehlversuchen, User-defined Exceptions"

It has clarified a lot of obscurity in my mind regarding what GIS actually is in real life and on application grounds. A more software oriented course that will provide a strong base in QGIS. 
Secondly, the tutor is really very clear and precise while explaining things. He has a good standard of teaching.
Finally, i was so elated when i completed each project. I learnt so many new things about GIS in such a short period of time...
Thank you for this course..."

The course was far from that. The interaction was really well done. The course was very helpful since I am training myself for a second career. I am currently an electrical engineer for an architectural / engineering firm and am looking forward to something new. The only real complaint was Udemy changing the interface to the web site. When I started the course I could have Atom and the browser window opened on a MacBook with enough spacing to see clearly. With the new web site it's almost impossible to you are constantly flipping from the lecture to Atom to another web page to test to a terminal etc.
Otherwise a great course that I'm sure I will refer back to."

100 Python Challenges to Boost Your Python Skills,David Montigny,2019-06-29 14:04:38+00:00,4.5,I ran into some issues using Python 3.7 as my own interpreter; I do not remember seeing which version was used for this course. I also found that many of the error messages do not correlate to the code used and using the error to decipher was wrong seemed impossible in a few cases. Seemed like the error was for a totally different question.

The course met my expectations and I believe it's a truly invaluable resource for the ones looking for Python language learning.
It's worth mentioning that I've experienced some issues related to the audio in some sections that I believe could be improved. Also, I've had some issues while trying to download the resources from section 22.
Thank you again!"

My one issue is more of a platform thing, but in order to complete the course and get the certificate I seem to have to watch all of the videos. However, there is a test at the start which more or less advises me to skip the first bit as it covers python basics that I do not feel for re-doing. Would be great if there is a way to tick that as viewed.

Would totally recommend."

A very good idea with exercises to be recreated by yourself. Although my solutions differed from yours, they gave the same result. As you wrote under one of the comments, if the result is correct, it means that everything is OK.
It's great that you showed examples of applications that do something ""real"", which is why I'm going to your next course.
At the end, I missed a bit that you did everything in Windows, and you did not show examples in iOS or Linux, but let's say that the problems I encountered and their solution were just an extra learning.
Thank you very much Adrit!"

Como una introducción podría valer. No obstante para alguien que NO sepa nada de programación es claramente insuficiente. Se mete con conceptos más avanzados demasiado pronto, que puedes reproducir sólo porque le vas siguiendo. Espero que el mega-course de python esté mejor estructurado.

Porque ele ensina a praticar, ele realmente mostra utilidade da programação. Esse foi praticamente o primeiro curso de programação que fiz. Faz um ano que estudo de entusiasta e não encontrei um curso que chegasse perto desse. Outros cursos ficam mostrando partes técnicas da linguagem que não servem para nada considerando o usuário médio, só um gênio iria conseguir sair de conceitos básicos para construir aplicações reais. Esse curso parte de aplicações reais para ensinar Python. Todos os cursos deveriam ser assim. Parabéns ao autor."

I have completed around 80% of the course and I feel that I have learnt more than from any other place. Ardit's way of explaining OOP is the best till now that I have heard.

I did struggle a bit with the ""input"" function as didn't realise I was running python v2 when in the ""PythonAnywhere"" console - so it errors when it tries to evaluate the result of input.   So had to run the code with ""python3 basics.py""   Maybe I'm silly but this took me ages to work out as I thought I had a error in my code.  ""python basics.py""  gives a frustrating error like ""NameError: Name 'Apple'  is not defined"" ."

Data Processing with Python,Nainesh Vashi,2019-05-29 10:35:44+00:00,4.0,"1. The video quality was changing through out each lecture.  For some time it used to be clear, then it used to become blurr, then after some time clear again and so on.
2. We also need to have some notes at the end of each lecture else it is easy to forget what was taught in the lecture.  Also, if we need to refer to the content later on, we should not require to open the video and go through it again.  Notes are much quicker for revision."

Data Processing with Python,Dickson Law,2019-05-14 20:31:25+00:00,3.0,"I picked up this course as part of an upcoming role transition to a metadata processing position. Though I appreciated the coverage on pandas, there were several unedited typos and filename mismatches in the videos that made the learning experience a hit-and-miss (e.g. -99999 instead of -9999 in the weather station data set). In addition, recent updates to the libraries taught in the course have invalidated some of the code (e.g. seaborn.plt no longer valid).

I started as a web/game developer and have some prior Python experience from an introductory university course, so I was able to work around the niggles and figure things out myself on the most part. But for others needing a more gradual and comprehensive coverage of basics (e.g. control structures, basic execution flows, etc.), this course probably wouldn't work as well and would just lead to copy-and-paste dependency."

excise based course makes me focused and interactive.

That because the teacher, although very patiently answering every question and giving very short, slow-paced lectures, still fails to explain throughoutly the logic behind the language. I can't help but to feel confused about the order of arguments and functions or about which way to choose when solving a problem. I'll keep taking the classes but to be very honest as a begginner I kind of regret buying the more ""straightfoward"" looking course instead of looking for a more didactical one. I hope I come back later to say I've changed my mind."

I am doing a degree in computer science and started out with Python in the first semester, but I wanted to refresh what I had learned as I hadn't had a chance to use it much in several months. Even though I mostly understood the program at the beginning I still started with the basics, it was a good reminder of some things and more importantly helped me really understand some things I didn't quite graps the first time learning python. Understanding error messages was definitely better explained here than what I initially taught, or at least what I remembered. 
I'm really looking forward to the projects which will let me experience even more of what Python can do. I highly recommend this course. Even if you already know a little bit of Python, if you're not fully confident in the basics or need a brush up this course will get you up to speed really quickly."

I have completed 75% of the course. Lecturer is actually writing and explaining codes line by line and solving errors (crucial). He is presenting it real with human errors and not just faking it by editing the video without any error. Loving it !!"

Useful for anyone trying to build a programming portfolio AS WELL AS entrepreneurs looking to starting a business and take advantage of data. The libraries that Ardit uses helps this course stand out from the others (who wants to waste their time building a simple calculator when Ardit's course has you go straight into things like web-cam motion detection, stock analysis and web scraping). Some things in this course require a certain level of problem solving programmer intuition, so I would easily recommend to anyone with a fair amount of programming exposure. Cheers!"

The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications,Coert Wigbels,2019-04-06 07:34:02+00:00,4.5,"Overall a really good course with a focus on real world application of Python. Ardit's delivery is a bit mumbly, but it is still easy to understand. I was happy I'd already done another course that explained the theory behind Python, Ardit isn't always great at explaining things (OOP for example), but he is really good at showing you how you can use these things in practice. There were some details in the course where outdated code hadn't been flagged, but overall I found it to be a really useful and fun course for a beginner like myself."
The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications,Abhishek Kumar,2019-04-06 06:17:42+00:00,5.0,Such a wonderful course. Happy to learn so much here. Thank you Ardit.

Would love a little more dive into the Classes used such as DataFrame etc to get a better understanding of the shape of it and how it is expected to be used, but am still understanding and learning.
On another note, I know it's 3 years too late, but following PEP8 in the code would have been great."

Covers a lot of different topics and actually gives you the background enough to start writing applications by yourself. I like also the parts with real-time troubleshooting, since it shows how it looks in reality. Also I liked the exercises in the earlier parts of the course. One thing that could be improved is to introduce similar exercises but more difficult ones in the later parts of the course.
Thanks!"

Python for Beginners with Examples,Jeremy Day,2019-03-26 23:11:04+00:00,2.0,"I was expecting/hoping for a more comprehensive approach to the basics of the Python language, with discussion and explanation of each topic. What I instead received was a seemingly haphazard run through, with only a cursory glance at select topics, and little to no explanation of how or why.

Additionally, the instructor was quite difficult to understand."

It offers users a chance to be exposed to some of the most common, in-demand needs for a Python programmer. Each section was broken down in a clear enough fashion to allow for comments to be made throughout each script. Most notable was the instructors way of leading viewers with each application, offering a means of self-verification as the applications were built. If I had to offer one recommendation for the course, it would be to include a bit more detail on certain topics, such as CSS and html, within the course. Otherwise, this is an excellent course for those looking to get started with Python application development, but aren't sure how."

I wanted a good course with a lot of examples  in many topics , 
and then I found this course , 
the most thing I like it about this course is being realistic , 
it helps narrowing the gap between studying and real life applications , it was really a great experience , 
thanks a lot for this course , you are a great instructor  
------
you will learn a lot if you are a complete beginner , 
but I highly recommend it for those who learnt programming but didn't make something real  , those who feel that they can't do any thing for real or work in this industry like me ,
I couldn't believe that I can work as a developer ""however I want to have career"" but this course made me feel that I have a good enough chance to be a good programmer developer it boosted my confidence !  and it's really a must to learn programming in this era of technology ! ,

I was able to built a web scraper in Python half way through.
One little thing I wish Mr. Sulce can improve on was the little typos from time to time in the lecture. While they serve good purpose on showing how most programming bugs come from, can still be a bit distracting and time-wasting.
Maybe introduce a lecture in linter?
Overall, a great class."

The name showing that you will get most of the python, but until now, about 40% of course, I'm still in basics that can be given in 1 hour of time MAXIMUM with examples!

There is nothing until now for the structure of the project, best practice of the structure, how to create your own library and modules and how to use them, from titles coming, I don't see anything promising.

My Review subject to change later, until now, 40%, totally waste of time."

I found this Cisco Networks Postbaccalaureate Certificate.  This course so far provides me solid footing to begin and make the journey.  This Cisco Unified Communication Manager is creating a single app for calling, messaging, meetings, and Team Collaboration. Can you assist with my directions of this desired goal?

I don't seem to find in realness in this.  I ask questions.  I know that no one reads them, nor can I find an acceptable answer on the frequently asked questions, so I mosey along.  Unacceptable

Ardit Sulce please read and respond:
I worked more five (5) hours today, and still don't have Python Anaconda installed.
I google as per your instructions in the class; however results doesn't show Python Anaconda the way it is on the class site.  If I go to the site https://www.python.org/downloads/, the site has Alternatives, but doesn't show what you instruct the student to do.

https://www.continuum.io/downloads 

I did find Anaconda Installer archive includes the one download (Anaconda3-2.3.0-Windowsx86_64.exe) that you show in the class.. Should I install this one from the Anaconda Installer Archive?  I cannot find this any place else of the places that you instructed in for me to go to.
Please answer soon, so that I can gain usage of this programming language.  Right now, I am very dissatisfied with the progress.  I so very much want to utilize this program language.

The way he is using command line prompt is bonus for people who are new to programming to learn command line prompt along with python.  Examples that are provided are good.  I like the Ardit's pace and the length of each lecture being short, which is allowing to follow along and try it."

The progression of difficulty was ideal, and the applications were interesting and potentially useful in many ways if developed further. Presentation was good. 

Several additions to the videos had been made (as of 3/19) to keep the matter up-to-date, despite 3rd party changes to many a package and API. Some other courses are not so kind or efficient as to do this, but here the effort was made, which was really great - very encouraging for the student! The support in Q&A was very helpful. There were plenty of hints on further topics to look up. 

Perhaps some more diagrams describing process or layout would be good during longer or more complicated topics (eg 20-224, introducing Bokeh with Flask, had a lot of talking but no explanatory diagrams meantime, whereas a very helpful diagram was shown throughout section 13 on TKinter layout). 

Overall an excellent course - useful Python matter, very well explained.

Much obliged."

1. The instructor keeps repeating very obvious things, giving me the impression that he doesn't have in mind what he was about to say. He also comes back and forth a lot when explaining the code so it feels disorganized.

2. The bad smell of his code. Just look at the final code of app 1, why repeating the ""get_close_matches()"" several times when you can wrap it up in a variable or function? As a programmer myself, I simply can't stand poor code like this.

3. The instructor's accent. It's even more irritating for me given that he keeps talking about unimportant things.

Things I like about this course (the only thing that still keeps me learning despite all things I don't like):

1. It successfully shows the broadness of what Python can do."

The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications,Rune Hansen,2019-02-19 09:55:23+00:00,3.0,"It started out nice and slow where I could follow along with ease, but all of a sudden I was expected do programming i barely understood and It was going from simple 1-5 unnested lines of code to all new never seen before ""myfile.dosomething().dosomethingelse()"" 5-10 lines nested within each other in if-for and while loops. and when i looked at the solution, I could clearly see that I would never have solved it on my own.

This is not very motivational way of learning and I have paused this curse in searched of other curses who does a more slow pace.

It would be much better to take a big clean advanced code, that could be broken down and then show and make us do the basics first then after a while take the same code and copy it in a loop and so on till the big code was finally written. Actually like Ardit did in the beginning of this curse. Instead he abandon this system rather quickly after the first example and jumps around with installing packages and thinks we can program (for me rather complicated stuff) after 50 lessons."

You need to be patient and walk along each chapter as it is longer but when you practice it along you will find it building confidence.

Note at times we face errors but for which you need to google and find the answers.

One small suggestion for the author is while he says pls reach out for any help I did not get a response and would appreciate if he could respond.

The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications,Viet Thien Thu Bui,2019-02-15 05:43:08+00:00,5.0,"I finished this course and this is my review.
I skipped (more like fast running) through all the basis because I am not a beginner to Python.  It took me more than a month to finish this.
My opinion: this course is perfect for someone who's just learned basis and want to make further use with Python.
This course teaches real applications such as web apps, web crawling, even automatic emailing,... which are really mainstream useful in real-life.
About the number ""10"", actually I would call them ""skills"" more than ""applications"" because they are small-scaled and probably a small function of a real-life application.
My tips when you consider buying this course:
1. Learn ahead Python as much as possible.
2. Get used to finding solutions on google.
3. turn speed of video to 1.5x if you feel frustrated by slow-speaker like me, :p  The teacher is German (as I guess) and he has some small accent (words like ""hour"" or ""Linux"") in it but wholly speaking his communication is more than fine. 
4. He has a really nice and active assistant and a lot of helpful learners in the course, so, take advantage of the Q&A even when you pass the lesson, still read a bit and see some worth-reading comments. This section is not only for asking, but sharing as well."

There were just few details missed out for total beginners like me. They were either skipped or very lightly touched...made me figure where those came from (e.g. the colon after a line, and how the next line is made without pressing Enter. I survived anyway by googling them. Overall it is good and thanks again."

The best in Ardit's courses is that you will always get new libraries, new ways to solve things. This course is not ""fast"". The description may fool you. You will have to search the internet to solve a few exercises, learn and re-learn new practices. 

This is a course that a beginner can take. But it will be more valued as a course to remember and revision the things you learnt in other Ardit's courses."

Each app introduces a new field of expertise such as Image Processing, Website Designing, Data Processing and Visualization, etc.

The course is moderately paced and the language is very easy to understand.

I have also done some C++ Exploring but haven't been able to do much with it. Mostly my issues were the IDE and how to debug a'm starting this class as a beginner because there were a few lines of the code I didn't know. The if statements were very easy for me. I still occasionally write psudo code.

I studied Python for a year in postgraduate studies --> OOP problem.
I bought a great book to learn Python --> OOP problem.
Tried to read online courses --> OOP problem.
Got this course --> eureka! It was really that simple?

Thank you Ardit, you were the only person that helped me to understand it (as you said - no dogs, cats, and other animals - let's try to write real application to see how OOP works - that was enough for me). After I finished your course I'm now able to rewrite any of my old app to OOP. I don't even write my new applications without using OOP anymore.

As of the rest of the course... it's huge. Author shows the basic parts of many python libraries. As I'm watching present job offers these libriaries are commonly required. And you as a student just learned their basics! What else do you need?"

I do think however that the introduction to python is rather a recap (fine for me as the full life beginner!) and I liked to start studying Python with more general approaches.  In my opinion, this course is rather a step 2."

The best thing I liked was that Ardit has not edited out the making of typos and mistakes in the coding - which has then led us to understand how to handle such errors during our own practice. Great job - and I am keen to enroll in some of the other courses that he offers as well.

100 Python Exercises: Evaluate and Improve Your Skills,Alexander Muhr,2018-12-27 23:38:25+00:00,4.5,"This is a great course for students that want to practice and improve their python skills. The exercises start simple and slowly progress in complexity throughout the course. Now that I've finished the course I feel quite confident in my ability to quickly write quality python code for a wide variety of purposes. It's great to be able to compare your code to that of the instructor. Often this reveals an alternate solution or a more efficient way to organize your program.

My only complaint is that some of the exercises early on are a bit too simple. I very much enjoyed the challenging exercises at the end of the course and would have liked to see a few more like that.

Overall a great buy and I highly recommend the course."

Server deployment info was a nice touch.  Would have enjoyed a lecture or two on Bokeh Dashboards."

The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications,Jesper Darville,2018-12-20 08:48:10+00:00,1.0,"This course is NOT for beginners (which was my expectation). 
The first section explains how to set up an environment on a virtual server with an online provider, without any explanation why. 

The instructor does not even bother to go to the official Python website; how to download and install Python on your computer, how it is stored on your computer or which programs that can used to run it on your computer. 

So, if you want to gain knowledge of simple things like how Python works and how to use it on your own computer, you need to head over to youtube for some real beginner videos, and while there, you might as well just stay there. 

Let's say you want to do some coding somewhere with no internet connection, then bad luck!

It should also be disclosed that Windows users has NO business in this course. 

On a positive note, the instructor seems very knowledgeable and uses a nice tone of voice. 


Because you will be lost already from the very beginning, I can only give 1 star and not recommend this course to beginners who really want to understand how this works."

Data Processing with Python,Fabiano Dias Ferreira,2018-12-18 19:08:12+00:00,4.5,"Another excellent course. Very good to grasp or revise pandas concepts and basics of seaborn and jupyter notebooks. And a very good course to begin before taking the Build 10 real Python Projects.

Ardit has a solid knowledge of this kind of data analysis. And even you maybe not entirely interested in GIS, this course was the best. Short, direct to the point and it served me as an aweasome training on creating functions, an inexpected bonus for me.

The only down thing is that you have to download a lot of things, my internet is not very good and the course could use a revamp to clean some parts, update few lines of code and reorganize the lessons a little better. There was too much ""file searching"" and since I was using Linux and I was used to use Linux file system and Jupyter notebook, I had to adapt some parts to work. Nothing major and, again, a nice bonus to practice this kind of operations with OS modules, input and output files."

Ardit, the tutor has a lot of empathy for the student and the way the topics are fully covered makes it a very enjoyable learning experience.

All software installation that was required and project progression went perfectly as described, including ones that had been updated since the lesson were recorded are clearly noted and described where necessary.

I found Ardit to be very knowledgeable and thorough with the lessons.

I would highly recommend this course to others.

John."

Python for Beginners with Examples,Carol Fowler,2018-12-06 17:23:56+00:00,3.0,"I am spending a lot of time on technical issues. I have finally downloaded anaconda and have spyder completed further then come upagainst another problem. I cannot download the pip install simplekml from the commandline. This meant I could not finish the course properly as the next lectures were mostly based on the kml.
I am fairly fine with most things. You teaching is well above average but the technical support is limiting and frustrating. I know that is nothing to do with your actual teaching but it plays a big part in time issues. Maybe a technical section where you say 'if you have a problem with this, this may be the answer', I find the Q and A section more limiting."

Ardit's course is fast-paced with easy-to-comprehend logic and theory as well as real-world applications that can easily be expanded to pad a beginner's portfolio. I'm looking forward to doing just that when I'm done with my certification course in January. I'm taking this course in preparation for that. There is so much you can do with python. One wonders what they need any other programming language for."

My only constructive criticism is that there is no section on developing structured, commented code for professional settings.

Thank you!

Thank you very much for your wonderful course, as a beginner, I really enjoy it and would like to give you some feedbacks:
Pros:
1. Very clear and concise. What I really like is that you showed us some error and taught us how to solve these error step by step, which is very important.
2. I really like the Q&A forum, there is always someone helped to solve my problem quickly.
3. The updating. Thank you for updating the content and tell us the place/version we need to change.

Cons:
If possible, I would like you to tell us the difference between OS. For example, when installing the virtual environment, we Mac users have pain without your guidance.

Oh, if possible, I would also want to know how to use documentation of a language, for example, some library, method, I think I need a more detailed explanation about how to use it.

Thank you anyway!
Have a good day always!"

However, most of those ""real world"" applications are not even close to commercial grade applications, their only use is to be in this course. I would say most of the coding is slopy, and should not be advertised. There could be a section about proper logging, exception handling, static analysis and unit testing just to show how real world software development is done."

By the end, thanks to the great explanations of Ardit, I feel I understood everything and that a new world opened up for me using Python. 
Before even finishing the course I was able to build my own working Korean-Hungarian dictionary app with graphical interface, which uses my excel word list as resource, so I'm quite satisfied.
I'd also like to mention a small but rather important thing about Ardit's teaching and videos: He makes mistakes, like simple typos - A lot :) But instead of cutting them out he left them in the videos so now I think I'm also more convenient handling syntax errors thanks to the fact I watched him correcting himself many many times.
Big Thanks, Ardit! I'll be looking forward to your next courses."

This is very good course to get started with Python and many might find applications usefully starting point for future projects. 

Personally I didn't like that Jupyter was used in so many cases in this course but that's just my opinion. Also you should name you python files with some other way than script1, app1 or mysite as you are teaching programming and naming should't probably be done in that way. 

Anyway,  very good useful course if you are fairly new to python and still learning syntax and capabilities of python."

I think it does a reasonable job in this respect with some of the medium/experienced exercises. Their difficulty/complexity level matched the ones that I got for live coding sessions over the phone in some interviews. Mind you, nothing to do with what to expect in a 'real' (on-site) coding interview, these screenings are meant to test basic coding knowledge and are usually done over the phone, with a live coding website, and take no more than 10 minutes.

The easy exercises, are a bit too simple in this respect, but they serve as a nice gentle introduction.

All in all a positive experience."

An example: the importance of why and when of A) ""Indenting your code"" and B) ""colons"", they are never explained but when either of them is not used at the correct times errors are all you get and they are needed a lot. 5 of the 10 applications completed so far and I have found them useful. I started this course a complete noob."

That is quite some time ago. 

The course went on hold for several months while occupied with real world python programming.

I recently took up where I left of and found that my weak points had bettered.

I finished the course - the last 55 lectures within 2 days.

I like the challenge the instructor presents and though we have very different styles we get the same results.

I can recommend anyone to take up the challenge."

Finde es auch nicht gut, dass er alles in der Kommandozeile macht. Was ich gut finde sind die Quizzes und Übungsbeispiele, weil diese wirklich zum Nachdenken anregen.

Für meinen Geschmack wurde in den Kurs viel zu viel reingepackt, damit man letztendlich das Etikett ""Mega"" anhängen kann. Das ist kontraproduktiv, weil letztlich ohnehin alles nur an der Oberfläche kratzt. Mich interessiert Web Scraping, das kommt im Kurs vor, aber ich weiß jetzt schon, dass es nicht so hilfreich sein wird. Stattdessen werde ich mir wohl einen anderen Kurs, der sich rein damit beschäftigt, kaufen.

Ich möchte dem Autor auch empfehlen sich ein Script zurecht zu legen, nach dem die Punkte abgearbeitet werden. Bei manchen Lektionen wird gelabert und gelabert, es zieht sich unnötig in die Länge. Komm auf den Punkt! Eigentlich schade. Für einen Einstieg reicht es, eher viel zu lang. Wie gesagt, bin erst bei der Hälfte und es ist wirklich mühsam. Werde wohl den Großteil nur punktuell ansehen und skippen."

I wrote in mainly cobol, VB6, java and TCL.
In the last 3 years, I'm writing automation in TCL.
I like to learn python since I know TCL is no relevance in the world.
I plan to master the python to find new job.

I looked at udemy and try some courses.
I saw that this course best suit me."

The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications,Phan Nhựt Hải,2018-10-27 01:06:59+00:00,5.0,"I would like to say thank you to Ardit Sulce . It is great for someone would like to know more what is Python can do. My career part is a programmer too, but in the other language. I already know a little of Python, however, I use it for small tasks of my job. I also search on the Internet what can we do with Python but it is too much, where I start with it. And, this course is introduce the real thing we can go with Python, it is perfect. Just small thing I suggest to instructor, that is you should insert the link to official python library, such as OpenCV, so we can find more detail of library can do and function.
Thank you"

The way Ardit teaches is so interesting that you don't have to put any efforts to understand anything. I have taken various other courses and found some topics to be very difficult. After going through Ardit's training program, I feel that there can't be a better way to teach you programming than this. Not just because he is teaching us by building real-world applications but also because his teaching skills are phenomenal."

Update : I'd say that at least Ardits answers questions asked from students (not all of them) but he tries i think as there's a lot of students asking. However you should know that if you want to take this course, it's you learning, but then you should try to explore by yourself in order to build the app you want, search for libraries and tools that help you to build something real. 
You know the syntax you know different tools after the course, but it won't make you build something great if you do not really invest a lot of time apart from the course."

What's different for me in taking this Python class is that the instructor gets immediately into a program that contains multiple topics i.e. dict, lists, functions, conditionals. You see all of these topics discussed together as opposed to other classes that deals with each of these topics individually and only puts them together later on...after you have forgotten. I'm really enjoying the class and the instructor's approach."

I learned to program decades ago and haven't used those skills much since then; this course has been an excellent way to jump right in with Python, though I admit it might be more appropriate for those with previous programming knowledge, rather than for absolute beginners. I've been working my way through the Learn Python3 The Hard Way textbook, but now I wish I'd watched these lectures first.

100 Python Exercises: Evaluate and Improve Your Skills,Niki Pa,2018-10-04 11:22:43+00:00,4.0,"It was good and useful. A bit too easy as for most of the exercises.  1 or 2 codes aren't working with me even when I just copy-pasted them, I don't know, why. I'm happy to solve them (except flask-related exercises, I'm not interested in them right now), I've learned a lot. Thanks."
The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications,Niki Pa,2018-10-04 11:16:50+00:00,4.5,"Python is my first programming language (except VB), and I was afraid. Ardit made it easy and understandable and now I am ready to try, if I cannot, with google and stackoverflow , and I am not so much afraid of CMD line and making errors. 
This package what he is showing is huge and I don't need them all. I'm interested in data analysis and webscraping and sql, not as much in flask. But this is all useful, and it was money well spent :) 
I don't know why someone complains about the accent, try a Vietnamese...or an American.. :)
Thanks."

I found the content very useful and I'm happy to have taken this course. I will use the content hopefully during work. 
Ardit has a nice manner and a pretty understandable accent compared to e.g. an US instructor (eg. I learned from Nick Parlante, and his accent is very heavy for me).
One thing: more practice would be great.
Thanks for that!"

You can always go back to the scripts and check how did you do this and that. Really good content which demystified many topics for me. 

Ardit (the instructor) is absolutely great. He takes time with explaining things, doesn't repeat himself and even go through the sometimes tricky installation process (along with leaving text note how to do it). The best part is that he still actively participates in the forum, answers and comments on  questions submited by participants.

Thanks for your work Ardit!"

1. The course is very resourceful.
2. The trainer is well aware of technology,very knowledgeable. The explanation of subjects is very cool. 
3. The course has a very steady space.
4. Among all I find stock analysis project (with flask/bokeh) has been excellent.

Expectations:
1. The code need to be revised time to time as those gone out-dated/deprecated
2. Some projects are similar, seem to be  interlinked, expecting to be independent of each other."

The hints where very useful and with the help of them I googled a lot and learned many new things about Python and its libraries.
I learned also many important to me libraries that include csv handling, database handling, gui (both windows and web interface) and finally got a glimpse of Flask which helped me feel more relaxed with my struggles with Django.
With my previous small experience on Python and better on other languages, I managed to get through all the exercises only with the hints and now I feel much more confident.
Generally it was money well spend for me."

Each section is roughly the same length, which kept me motivated. (Another course had 1 section which lasted 18 hours, and other courses lasting 1 hour). This course is great because each section is short and sweet too.

I wish there were more exercises to be done separately, as that challenges me and lets me improve. There is only 1 challenge right at the end.

Thanks Ardit"

Especially I appreciate the proper pedagogic approach in the way how authors gradually introduce more and more complex concepts to us. As the person with SW development background I, naturally, try more complex and complicated approaches, (and it requires some research) but presented materials give enough information for start. One small remark - it will be VERY useful to make special emphasis on a style. Good code is not only working code but what is more important - it has to be a READABLE one firsthand! Because programmers spend more time on reading code than on writing it. 
And the more complex code will be the more readable it has to be, otherwise it will be just discarded and replaced. Or misused."

Getting really good at coding is a long and hard battle, no matter how smart you are. A possible solution?

As with so many skills, the most effective teachers are time and repetition.  

Best selling author Anders Ericsson, PhD, Professor for Psychology calls this “deliberate practice”.

Good luck!"

The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications,Tan Xuan De Kelvin,2018-09-17 05:57:38+00:00,5.0,"Very glad that I took the dive into this course.  I had tried to start my Python journey with the 'dry concepts' such as syntax and writing code that does not do anything but to prove concepts - This proved to be too boring and unsustainable. 
This course however, really kept me interested. Ardit is a genius - other than for the excitment of building practical applications for the student, he uses these applications to strategically cover the concepts in both Python and the key libraries that we will likely use in the future. 
I would recommend beginners like myself to start here, and then continue self-studying by looking up the details in each concept for a more in-depth understanding.

The course content is very educational, relevant, clearly-explained and well-maintained. Libraries and functions are continually reviewed and followed up by Ardit to ensure that students have a frictionless experience in using them. Minus the things that are out of his control, the effort here by him is very impressive. The amount of detail and explanations for the concepts are well-balanced. 
One minor thing I would recommend as improvement: A printable summary of key concepts with codes after each section for easy reference and revision. I find myself heavily commenting my code in fear that I would forget what I have learnt - not sure if I am supposed to memorise them or if this is the right way to learn.

Long story short: To anyone who is reading this; have no doubt. This is the course to take. Highly recommended."

The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications,Michael OBrien,2018-09-14 15:36:22+00:00,5.0,"I came into this course with a fair knowledge of Python, all self taught, and was looking to increase my knowledge overall and specifically learn more about areas such as GUI applications, working with databases, and web front end/back end development with Python.  I gained everything I wanted and more.

This course is long, and it covers a lot of material, but if you stick with it, do the exercises, and pay attention you will learn a lot.  I would recommend having a notepad near your computer and making notes.  Everything seems obvious as you're doing it, but in a week, or a month, it won't be anymore.

The course is a couple of years old so Python has been updated, some of the modules and libraries have been updated, etc. so be prepared to actually program, figure a thing or two out, or god forbid actually Google something to get an answer.

In my opinion, having to actually figure out why 1 or 2 little things don't work instead of being spoon fed everything helps and will make you a better programmer in the long run.

Ardit is an excellent instructor.  He explains things well, and instead of just showing working code all of the time he will break the code at critical points and show you the error that you will get if you make a mistake.  As you finish a section of the course and the application you are building he will suggest ways for you to improve it on your own so that you can build on the program and increase your skills and knowledge.

This course isn't perfect, no course is, but this is an excellent resource and learning tool and I highly recommend it."

Not sure why. It was a straightforward install. It just wouldn't load a terminal window so I could run a python script. Applied the updates and everything started (slowly) working. It also took me longer than I'd like to admit to tell Atom where the Python script files were located. Mostly just my ignorance/stupidness.

I have learned an incredible amount by being forced to research the exercises rather than just mindlessly copy from the internet. Ardit covers all areas you would need to know to be a Python expert. The great thing about lifetime access is that you can continually test your knowledge by re-attempting the exercise but minimising the research you do on repeat attempts. Superb.

This course has given me an in-depth understanding of how python syntax works. The instructor is very clear and the overall real world application development is fun. After you finish building one app you get excited for the next one. This shows that the tutors and the structure of the course itself is very well balanced and thought of, to get you going with python programming. 

Only if the course had plenty more brain storming short exercises to fine tune what we learned throughout the course it would be even better - 5/5 probably!!!

I highly recommend it!!!"

It jumped from installing to variables, strings etc. It did not go over establishing a definition for anything. I just followed what was said but some of the errors I encountered and some I've seen questions about were due to certain topics were not discussed in detail. Someone new would not understand you need to def everything not just int and variables. This becomes apparent in the if, else, indentation section. It did not advise you to define ""year"" and some students were getting errors. at the beginning of every new lesson make sure you remind students to define a value. I definitely feel more could have been explained in depth. overall it was good."

 - Structure: The course is not structured well enough within the videos, and I often find myself having to drop back into the Dashboard to keep track of where I am. Furthermore the skills you acquire in Python is given by example, and not much guidance is provided on how to find out how to do something in Python for yourself.
 - ""Cheap"": The target market may be people wanting to try everything that's free. But I would have liked more examples or guidance on more 'serious' or professional development of apps. For instance hosting a web app via Azure, or using better GUI tools in Python."

Data Processing with Python,David Ravnsborg,2018-08-21 06:55:01+00:00,3.0,"Reasonably comprehensive overview, but scattered and inconsistent presentation. Chapters have changed and the course structure doesn't flow nicely. Downloadable files don't match for each video (looking at you chapter 6), which is annoying because I've found my time is much more effectively spent watching the videos then downloading the files - because Ardit gives good explanations, but hammers out code rapidly while continuing to talk. For your non-iPython focused videos (those I follow along with as we do them), I'd much rather download the file afterwards.

Also, Ardit's mic volume is turned too low and, although relatively clear, I find the author to be difficult to engage with when he sighs and draws out his explanations. 

However, for someone entirely new to Python who follows along 100% through all his videos and doesn't expect to rely on downloadable files, I can recommend this as being a good fit. You just may need to pause frequently when Ardit goes from his drawn out (but often helpful) explanations to hammering out 5 lines in 10 seconds without dropping a beat."

One aspect of the course which I would have liked to have seen more of are the exercises where you work on short Python problems to reinforce and practice what is taught in the lectures.  These were there in the earlier stages of the course, but seemed to dwindle as the course progressed.  

As the instructor has made another course available which focuses on working on 100 Python exercises, I have already signed up to take that course as that is exactly what I'm looking for to improve upon what I've learned from the Python Mega Course, and simply just to practice.

After completing the course, my interest in continuing to learn Python has only increased.  I would recommend this course to anyone looking to get into Python and to be introduced to its versatile capabilities."
The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications,Kyoko Fukuda,2018-08-15 23:37:40+00:00,3.5,I appreciate that explanations are logical (despite easy or difficult). This helps me learn better and easier. It is a reason why I had joined this course so thank you.

Concepts of programming like loops etc are still to be learnt. However I am completely satisfied with what I have learnt. Sufficient time is given to build the basics / Syntax. Also reference to learning python on Linux was a plus in the course. Sufficient exercises were given, which helped understand the basics. However there is a feeling that the basics and syntax is not complete without understanding how programming is done."

Trainer seems to have very good understanding of the language and knows how to make anyone comfortable with Python. His way of teaching concepts is very good. Course material is good covering from basics to advance topics. Recommended to anyone who wants to learn Python.

I had learned java before taking this course but could not understand the stucture and flow of the script written with java. After finishing this course, I found it easier to understand the structure of programs in java.

 So the lessons I learned in this course, I can also apply to other languages than python. Due to your course, I am confident i can build my own python applications. 

Thank you for teaching this course."

Ardit explains very well the different subjects (which I wrote as comments line in my different app.py's. 
The course showed me the potentials of python, so I am motivated to continue learning python (and use it instead of the other languages). If Ardit would not have been so enthusiastic and instructive, I would not have considered it.
The forum is also very responsive, and to the point.

I enjoyed it a lot, and for a couple weeks, I had a very fine programmer-buddy. 

Well done, Ardit!

For someone who already knows how to program (as is my case)  and is trying to learn Python, the pace is slow most of the time. 

The other problem is that too many libraries are covered before learning the language basic syntax and standard libraries. This makes the course confusing at times. 

Another course by the same author : ""Solve 100 Python Exercises"" was a better option for me."

I decided to buy it and what can I say, I finished this course at the beginning of February a lot of things happened in between, but this course got me going, this course helped me realise, I'd like to learn more! Later I started learning PHP, got an internship and I am starting a junior dev job in August.
So if you're reading this, unsure whether programming is or is not for you, give this course a try. Try to push yourself to do something an hour, two, or four each day after work. Don't quit until you finish the whole course. After being done with it, you'll know whether this is the right path for you!
I'd like to say a big thank you to Ardit!
Tom"

This course was perfect for me. I've skipped the basic syntax part and went directly to the projects. The instructor shows what kind of things are possible with python. I've gotten so many personal project ideas from this course, and I know now how to start working at them."

But it is quite engaging from the beginning and it's likely to continue the same way. I think, the examples and applications in the course gives the basic logic behind Python which is essential to proceed forward with your own ideas and improve your Python skills after finishing the course. The clarity of the courses is a big plus, they don't bore you with complex and intense sections. I recommend this course to people who wants to learn and productively use Python but doesn't know where to start and what are the capabilities of this language."

It's great, don't get me wrong, but the instructor didn't give any direction towards an alternative, i.e. straight in the text editor itself. The project I was most interested in, the web scraping, was all in Jupyter (which is pointless for me). Overall, the course was good, it's just not my style. I prefer coding in the text editor."

Instructors voice is clear and easy to understand. I could comfortably listen to lessons at 1,75x speed. 

In some sections (webmaps) the voice was mixed too quiet, so I had to turn up the volume, but it was a minor nuisance. 

All in all, this feels like an excellent way to get started with python. You get to the exciting stuff quickly."

Great for somebody, who finished beginners tutorial for example has read a book and now thinking of creating some simple application. 
This course can give you an idea, it touches the water of what you can do with python. Another positive aspect is that you can get back to certain points if you are confused. Q&A sections solves most of the issues you can meet. 
Follow it step by step, think of something you can make use of and do your own application. My favourite one was with bokeh and pandas. I find it very practical. 
I didn't like one thing. The final app should be at the end of every app to set the knowledge into your head. 

Thank you very much!"

If you are teaching this much in two hours people will not remember that and will not be able to understand what is going on. If you give them tasks they will get more idea if they will do that task on their own.
The quiz after lectures are too basic . Anybody can answer those basic questions.

Accept above everything is good"

100 Python Exercises: Evaluate and Improve Your Skills,Robert Tavoularis,2018-07-15 22:37:27+00:00,5.0,"The hard part about learning is that a topic seems clear when you're reading about it, but you don't often know what you don't know until you are challenged to solve a problem.  That is where this course is great, Ardit clearly put alot of time and thought into coming up nugget-sized problems that take anywhere from 1-20 minutes to solve in order to make sure that a topic is understood.

This course helped me immediately by making me aware of some things that I either wasn't aware existed, or that I said I would learn one day but never got around to learning:
-atom w/ platformio-ide-terminal plugin
-pandas
-tkinter
-pretty print

I am grateful for having took this course, as it has immediately improved my python capabilities."

I think this is because the author took the trouble to map out the concepts step by step, which allows me to learn and enjoy Python. And the author, Ardit, speaks in clear English speech. The quizes are also focussed on concepts being taught, with an occasional challenge to think farther. Awesome experience. Highly recommended."

另外雖然網站有教學如何使用google翻譯中文字幕，我個人英文程度也不是很好，但我絕大多數字幕都是觀看英文字幕，搭配翻譯以及網上搜尋相關資料，我認為觀看英文更能了解到一些專有名詞的英文詞彙，以及學習相關詞彙，能更好的搜尋資料，畢竟英文的相關資料還是大於中文的，因此也推薦直接觀看英文字幕。"

I was able to following along comfortably and complete each section while expanding my comfort zone. I feel that I've been equipped well enough to now dive deeper into many subjects say from building Flask applications or to further pursue Data Science techniques. 

Lastly, the instructor Ardit was very easy to follow and I would certainly recommend this course to a friend. I hope he comes out with more classes in the intermediate to expert level range to help us to build more complex and challenging projects."

Explanations of concepts and the applications of methods to coding with python packages were eye opening and empowered one to explore other features in the packages.

Great course worth doing if you are into Python programming or just started.

Personal note. Ardit's way of showing how errors occur and how to resolve them in the lectures, provided me the confidence in the scripts I now write."

First  i was a bit skeptical but after starting the course i was relieved. The course also goes through the basic of python3 which was all i wanted to get started. Ardit is a great tutor and his way of teaching is one of the best i have come across. There are good  number of exercises for practice and code. Will recommend anyone who wants to learn python and want to know how it can help us in real world.

Since I'm an intermediate user of Python, I skipped most of the earlier sections/lectures.  The later sections and lectures were challenging but he also gave good explanations and good examples to follow.

Also, he seems to care about his courses.  There was one or two videos that he said he had to redo because the library had changed so he didn't let this course mothball due to improvements/changes to the libraries.

The examples and exercises helped reinforce what he taught in the lectures.  I loved the real world application projects too, which are a step above the examples and exercises to further teach his points.

For me, coming up with ideas to practice what I learned is a little difficult so I love more exercises and projects to do but all in all, on a scale of 1-5, I give him a 12  :D"

What i do not like is that you are using command line instead of IDE such is pycharm that makes opening, viewing and reviewing files more efficient and looks much better. It also helps with beginner mistakes in typos and suggests already declared variables or available methods/functions, which makes things more efficient and easy to overview. But ok, intention is to learn to do things with command line. Let me do something practical now :)"

The lecture videos are too short, example 2min, 5min, 8min. The video could have been about 10 minutes atleast by combining two or more sessions in one. 
In the lecture of first python program,  in addition to using the online service such as PythonAnywhere, tutor could have illustrated an example with a different method and the basic of getting python, simplest offline text editor like SublimeText(or else), then writing the code and then running python.
Rest i have to see and learn. 
Thank you for this Course."

The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications,Tim Kruger,2018-05-29 10:28:43+00:00,2.0,"I couldn't get some of the apps to work, like section21, where I couldn't get an the Email to send to my account and there was another lesson like that too.  I tried looking on line(couldn't find the answer) asked and posted my problem got 1 reply which I already but didn't work and never got any help after that. (This happened a few times) 

Also switching platforms and not giving directions on how to do something on another platform when it's different.  Since I'm a beginner and he was using windows(sometimes) and I'm using a mac, I spent hours trying to get a program to run and then him not saying or posting that to get it to run is a little different on a Mac.  Needed more directions for people that are complete beginners and using a different platform than what he's using.  

Also more exercises after lessons would be nice to practice what was taught.

Positives are that he goes over a lot of info."

Bear with my essay! I'm excited.
By the way I didn't pause on the course. I kept going. I needed it.

Thanks and thanks and thanks and thanks

Before now I have searched for a course on python since falling in love with the language years ago. There were just bits and pieces here and there but then along came Ardit! 

Here, I was able to piece together the different aspects of the language into something really functional. I can now go through codes I have sat down studying to no avail and immediately get what is happening. 

I know I have some ways to go in practicals but I am confident that I will do good because I know how to get dirty in things like this. 

Finally, I have a 18months old son and it turns me on to know that once he can add 2 and 2, we will do great things together and he will do greater for himself.

Thanks Ardit. I will have folks out here know that there is a great and REAL python course out there for real learning.

PS: I am a Filemaker developer and I do have solutions for school info mgt. Now I can host my own apps where my client schools can have a site for enrollment developed by myself while avoiding the cost and time to deliver same with FM. How beautiful.

Greetings from Lagos, Nigeria.
-Paschal.

Finaly I finished that cource! and I want to say THANKS! That is a really useful!
First that I want to say. English is not my native language and my level is not so good. But I didnt face with translate problems. Ardit is a good teacher (that may be important for some students)
The course was instructive. Ardit  explained with details sometime more then needed ;)
 I faced with a real projects. Especial good lessons was about Data and I going to learn more abot this
I strong recomend this cource for students who learning Python. Best way if you have some basic knowlege. If not - dont worry! This cource contain necessary lessons
PS
That cource should cost more;)"

By focusing on real-world applications, and exposure to multiple libraries, this course has helped me think ""what else can I do?"" with the applications taught.
Also useful, Ardit keeps any errors and exceptions made during programming instead of editing them out. This is really useful as he then proceeds to show how to problem-solve and debug the program. If I had any comments for Ardit it would be to keep the course live and up-to-date as I know I won't be the only one who will have a successful future programming thanks to his course, and thank you very much for putting it together."

Ardit definitely knows his stuff & goes to explain the process in a deep yet easily understood manner. I also like the fact that even the basic concepts seems to be leading to REAL WORLD scenarios & applications!

One thing that I also like about the teacher is that he does his best to answer my questions in both the Q & A and also via PM.

Ardit's lesson's are interesting, practical, and cover a wide variety of topics. His lessons are easy to follow.  I believe that his lessons garner an intuitive understanding of Python. 

The syntax in my version of Python differs a little from Ardit's but he did a good job leaving notes to help us out when we get lost.  But this definitely has been a source of frustration at a few points during this course. There are some sections that I have skipped due to these issues."

I really only decided to start again to help my children. I had my doubts that I would be able to pick it up again and particularly as I had decided on a language that I was not at all familiar with. However, I can say that I am thoroughly enjoying this course. The only reasons that I have given four stars as opposed to higher is that some of the lessons feel a bit short and sometimes some of the lessons feel as though they have been 'sped' through. I appreciate that you pause and go back over the lessons to your hearts content so it is not a big critisism. I am very happy so far with the course and would recommend it."

Only downside is that as software has new versions some of the code will not work directly and you need to figure out what has changed. Though this is a problem with all software based courses it and it is mentioned in the Q&A at several chapters, it would be really great if a warning appears in the video, or  a Q&A post for each lecture where things have changed. Some issues were mentioned as far as 8 months back. The author has had ample time to figure out how to deal with this more effectively."

If I could ask him to maybe slow down the pace a little as I am a complete beginner in Python, that would have made the difference in giving a 5 star.
Needless to say, I am happy with what I have learned, and I know that I could always go through it again to make sure I fully understand the concepts for future app-building and to develop my python skills even more.
Thanks Ardit."

Using what I have learned in the course to make an online CV with apps showcasing my new skills.

Thanks a lot!"

One thing I have to note is, having already taken another full introductory / more detailed course on Python basics I believe that made me more comfortable with the content of this course. So although I definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn python I would suggest that they first get slightly familiar with the language from another full on beginners course or just youtube videos."

I liked the fact that many different tools were used and I had the opportunity to see other implementations of Python code than just data analysis.
I highly recommend this course! I think it is even better for people who have at least basic programming skills. The instructor makes you like Python and makes programming fun :) Encourages to build your own projects and apps. I like this style of teaching."

Ardit was really good in explaining the concepts and pointing out the common errors which programmers do. The tools, modules and packages are explained well w.r.t their use. Of course one could not include all the package structure, but he tried his level best and within the course limit.
I started as a beginner and I really learned a lot and I think, I am doing pretty good with python now."

I did make mistakes , I spent hours in a couple of section figuring out
why my code is not working or the results did not match the course 
output. I trusted your learning principles and applied them. It was this more than learning python that I take from this course, How to debug and troubleshoot your code.
I know it is hard to keep your course updated to current versions of python and its modules , but again working through the problems I could come up with a solution.
 This course  is worth more than the five stars."

I started before Ardit updated the course with more in-depth Python basics classes in the first third of the course, but I went back and did those as well. But the first time around, I was lost in the beginning, and then as Ardit went through more real-world applications, my knowledge picked up speed pretty quickly. There were a couple of times I was stumped and couldn't figure things out because Ardit focuses more on Windows and I have a Mac, but I did finally figure out the problems, even if it was several videos (and a lot of Googling and Stackflowing) later. I really enjoyed the diverse applications, and I really, really enjoyed the web scraping, Postgres, and the last student-built application challenge! Great course: I would highly recommend it. Also, great bonuses!"
